## Things Learned:

&nbsp;<br>

- Used "grid-template-areas" for the first time â€” so cool & powerful!! Used to easily change the order of the banner items between desktop and mobile layouts.
- First time creating a working shopping cart with add to cart buttons and ability to adjust quantities in the cart.
- First time to implement a "notification" that pops out when an item is added to the cart.
- Learned about "e.currentTarget", which fixed a bug where the "Coral Bits" cart button was returning a data attribute value of "null".
- It was fun getting the random bubbles to float up the entire page with vanilla css.
- More practice using Context. (used for shopping cart state)
- More practice creating a mobile menu (including animated hamburger menu that flys out)
- Learned that a p tag is not allowed inside a button. ðŸ¤¨
- Been playing around with how I like to organize files in a Next project using css modules â€” this time I housed all the css files within the styles folder that is already present in a next project. On the [Men in Black Agent Portal project](https://github.com/brandicameron/MIB) I kept the css modules next to each component, which I think I like better.
