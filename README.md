## Things Learned:

&nbsp;<br>

- Used "grid-template-areas" for the first time â€” so cool & powerful!!
- Learned about "e.currentTarget", which was fixed a bug where the "Coral Bits" cart button was returning a data attribute value of "null"
- I was unaware that p and header tags are not allowed inside a button. ðŸ¤¨
